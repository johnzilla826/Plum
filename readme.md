### Plum: Simple Double-Entry Accounting

A simple yet functional web interface for managing double-entry bookkeeping. This project is in its extremely early developmental stages. The goal for v1 is to provide a stable accounting workflow:

- Accounts (CRUD)
- Transactions (CRUD)
- General journal
- Financial reports (income statement, balance sheet)

#### Technical notes:
- Stable SQLite schema
- Clean, minimal UI
- Ready for small-scale usage
